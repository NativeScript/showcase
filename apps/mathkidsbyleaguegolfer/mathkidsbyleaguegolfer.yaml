It has multiple student support with the ability to choose the difficulty or grade that matches your student's ability. Using its practice mode, you can target difficult areas including sequential or random multiplication tables. Finally, it has an innovative feature to type your answer going right to left as you would solve a difficult math problem. For example, to answer 51 minus 28 and with the feature enabled, you'd type "3" then "2" for your answer of "23".
